# Development Log

## API Documentation Added (2025-05-07)

Created a detailed API documentation file `docs/API_Detailed.md` that provides comprehensive information about:

-   Authentication mechanisms for both REST and WebSocket APIs
-   Common data structures used in the API
-   REST API endpoints for push monitors, badges, status pages, metrics and entry page
-   WebSocket API including:
    -   General connection flow
    -   Client-sent events with parameters and callback formats
    -   Server-sent events with payload details
    -   Error handling approaches

This documentation will be useful for developers integrating with Uptime Kuma or building extensions/tools around it.
